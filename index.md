Welcome to my blog, which is about solutions to many online judge.
BTW, this blog will be in Chinese.

## hello, world!

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
	std::cout << "hello, world!" << std::endl;
}
```

When \\(a \ne 0\\), there are two solutions to \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\) and
they are $$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$
